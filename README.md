# What’s new in Swift 5.4?

This is an Xcode playground that demonstrates the new features introduced in Swift 5.4: 

* Improved implicit member syntax
* Multiple variadic parameters in functions
* Creating variables that call a function of the same name
* Result builders
* Local functions now support overloading
* Property wrappers are now supported for local variables
* Packages can now declare executable targets
